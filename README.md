Car Price Prediction

This project aims to predict the price of cars based on various features such as mileage, brand, model, year of manufacture, etc. The dataset used for training and testing the model is sourced from [source link]. It employs machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Linear Regression for prediction.

Email Spam Detection

This project is focused on classifying emails as spam or non-spam (ham) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset used contains labeled emails with indications of spam or non-spam content. The project utilizes text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms like Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.

Iris Classification

This project focuses on classifying iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal dimensions. It employs machine learning classification algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. The dataset used contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species.
